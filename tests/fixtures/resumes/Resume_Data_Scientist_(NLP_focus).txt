### **Work Experience**

**Senior Data Scientist (NLP Focus)**
**TechVision AI, Beijing** | *Mar 2021 – Present*
*   Led the development and deployment of a customer intent classification system using BERT and RoBERTa, improving automated ticket routing accuracy by 35% and reducing average handling time by 25%.
*   Architected and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for the internal knowledge base, enabling a ChatGPT-like Q&A system that decreased information retrieval time for support staff by 60%.
*   Built and fine-tuned custom NER models to extract key entities (e.g., product names, technical issues) from unstructured customer service logs, automating data entry for over 10,000 monthly tickets.
*   Collaborated with MLOps engineers to containerize NLP models using Docker and establish CI/CD pipelines on Kubernetes, ensuring robust model serving and A/B testing capabilities.
*   Mentored 2 junior data scientists on best practices in deep learning, model evaluation, and code versioning with Git.

**Data Scientist**
**GlobalE-Commerce Inc., Shanghai** | *Jul 2018 – Feb 2021*
*   Developed a multi-label text classification model to categorize product reviews into sentiment and aspect categories (e.g., "Battery Life - Negative"), providing granular insights that informed product development priorities.
*   Implemented a semantic search engine for the product catalog using Sentence-BERT, enhancing search relevance and increasing user click-through rate by 18%.
*   Conducted topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic) on user-generated content to identify emerging market trends and customer pain points, presenting findings to the product management team quarterly.
*   Automated the generation of weekly analytics reports on customer feedback, saving approximately 15 analyst hours per week.
